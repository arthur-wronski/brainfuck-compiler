## An interpreter for BrainFuck.

My second Java project after the WAR card game. Chose BrainFuck for the small instruction set and humorous value.

Absolute treat to code in Java with IntelliJ, will probably move on to a more complicated language like Pascal or a simplified version of Visual Basic

TODO: finish interpreter to handle loops, optimise operations (e.g. bundling consequent increments or head movements into a single operation), tests, parsing exceptions
